1. What is the difference between readyState and status in XMLHttpRequest?

- readyState indicates the current state of the request. It changes from 0 to 4:
q0 – UNSENT: Request not yet created
1 – OPENED: Connection set up
2 – HEADERS_RECEIVED: Server response headers received
3 – LOADING: Receiving data from server
4 – DONE: Request completed and response is ready

- status shows the HTTP response code from the server.

200 (OK)
404 (Not Found)
500 (Server Error) 
------------------------------------------------------------------

2. How can you make the request asynchronous?

- By setting the third parameter in xhr.open() to true.
  Example: xhr.open("GET", "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1", true);

  - This allows the script to continue running while waiting for the server response.

3. Why is asynchronous communication recommended for web applications?

- Because it prevents the browser from freezing while waiting for a response.
  - It allows other tasks (like user interactions or rendering) to continue.
  - It improves performance and user experience by loading data in the background.
